# QuBit  OpenTag  JavaScript Library

## Welcome to the QuBit OpenTag wiki!

## Simple package
* **Easy to use**: QuBit &lt;OpenTag&gt;javascript library has been initially developed by [QuBit Products](http://www.qubitproducts.com) to help and simplify javascript serving for web sites. Especially with the ever growing number of online tools, today?s developers and marketeers face a new challenge of managing and deploying various number of tags on their websites.
* **Optimum Design**: After using this technology successfully on many high traffic sites, [QuBit Team](http://www.qubitgroup.com) has decided to open up their Javascript and allow anyone to write their own container tag service.

## Made for sharing
At QuBit we believe that Tag Management should be accessible to all
businesses and website owners. With this in mind:

* QuBit has created together with the Enterprise version, two
free packages: (a) a hosted package which gives you up to a
million page views per month for free; 
(b) a package that lets
you take the script and host it yourself.
* QuBit has opened up its code so that the community can use it
in their own websites as well as develop and evolve it.

## Contribute
* Founded by Xooglers, QuBit Group engineers use disruptive
technologies and approaches to help businesses understand
their data, and QuBit <Open Tag> is the first in a series of
products.
* We are working full time, but in order to succeed we need
talented developers who can collaborate in their free time.
* Get involved in the creation of the first Tag Management
system available in open source, free hosted. We are always
open to new ideas!
* Gain experience working with some of the UK?s most savvy
engineers and become recognized as contributing towards our
first product.
